The bird data was generated with an extension to the generation script. The script is generating as a CSV file (semicolon delimited because of the commas in RGB values). The uploaded version of the data is annotated and should be a more traditional 'comma-delimited' CSV file. If you have any issues reach out to @NFTBirds on twitter!
